# Architecture Tools
This repo serves as an index for the review tools I created in CS 3330 (Computer Architecture).

[Jquery Quizzes](http://people.virginia.edu/~stg2bd/arch_quizzes/Spring_2017.html)
-------
Old quizzes with some added jquery magic.

[Basically infinite Pipeline Practice Problems](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~stg2bd/simulator2/test.php)
------
Generated at random. Special thanks to Layne Berry for the generation of random instructions.

[HCLRS Debugger](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~stg2bd/debug.html)
------
Translates HCLRS text output to an interactive debugging program with JQuery.
If wanted, I can probably get permission to post the source code.
